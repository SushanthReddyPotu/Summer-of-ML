# SoM Week 3
Welcome to Week 3 of the Summer of Machine Learning 2025. This week weâ€™ll dive deeper into understanding model behavior and improving model performance. We will cover Overfitting, Underfitting, the Bias-Variance Tradeoff, Regularization techniques (L1, L2, Ridge, Lasso), Feature Transformations (Scaling, Categorical Encoding, Bag of Words), important Evaluation Metrics (Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, AUC-ROC), and algorithms like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
