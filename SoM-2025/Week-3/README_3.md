## üìÅ Project Title: Spaceship Titanic - Alternate Dimension Prediction

This is a machine learning project built around the **Spaceship Titanic** dataset from Kaggle. The objective is to predict which passengers were teleported to another dimension during a cosmic event. The task uses various classification models, focusing on **Logistic Regression** & **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**.
